2. Implement testing strategy
3. Optimize development workflow
4. Document API integration patterns
5. Set up monitoring and error tracking

## Technical Priorities
1. Component documentation and organization
2. Test coverage implementation
3. Performance optimization
4. Security hardening
5. Development workflow automation

## Open Questions
1. What is the testing strategy and current coverage?
2. Are there specific performance bottlenecks to address?
3. What monitoring and error tracking should be implemented?
4. Are there specific security requirements to implement?
5. What are the deployment and scaling requirements?
